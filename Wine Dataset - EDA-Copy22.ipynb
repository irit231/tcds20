       "109831  With a strange pink color and powdery nondescript aromas, this is shapeless and lacking in structure. Weak bitter flavors are completely fruitless; overall this seems to be going nowhere good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "20318   This gentle, quaffable wine offers light flavors of strawberry and apple. There's generous acidity, and despite the fairly substantial alcohol, it's modest in its proportions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "29220   The extra year gives this wine quite different flavors from the forward fruitiness of Provence rosé. It now has a richer, more complex character and weight of ripe fruit, caramel and vanilla flavors.

       "41927   Aromas of spiced plum, coffee, leather and underbrush come together in the glass.

       "87542   This is an elegant Syrah, blended with 18% Mourvèdre and topped with a splash of Grenache. Good phenolic ripeness along with substantial sugars lead into flavors that have melded nicely. Berry, truffle, chocolate, leather, pepper and coffee are all in the mix, and the mid-palate is delicious. Only a fairly quick fade keeps the score from climbing even higher.                                                                     \n",

Those strong components are accented with touches of cola and earth and a subtle undercurrent of barrel toast.                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "86613   Planted in 1979, the Wädenswil block brings raspberry, cherry and cola flavors together into a nicely textured wine with a wide streak of vanilla. Round and forward, it gently resolves into a balanced finish with light highlights of herb, nutmeg and coffee.                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "69608   Given sufficient time to open up, this cool-vintage wine brings notes of dried herbs, chocolate, anise, pencil lead and wood spice. The luscious chocolate and cherry flavors are soft, supple and concentrated, with enough tannins to benefit from additional time in the cellar. Drink after 2016 or give it a two-hour decant.                                                                                          \n",
       "107172  A full, rich wine, showing red fruits at their best. It has structure and layers of bright acidity. It's not a wine for long aging, likely to be at its best in three years time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "58507   You'll find alluring scents of black-skinned berry, baking spice, violet, a hint of leather and a balsamic note on this well-structured red. The chewy palate shows dense black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice, clove and pipe tobacco alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. A hint of cinnamon closes the finish. It's already approachable but also has great mid-term aging potential. Drink through 2023.   \n",
       "53986   There's a noticeable fruit yogurt element to the nose that gives this Prosecco Brut a milky, heavy quality. The wine offers dense, frothy bubbles and a slightly sour note on the finish. Made by Riunite, the wine has 10% Chardonnay for extra richness and structure.                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "81212   This offers a classic Zin nose, with dried strawberries, plums, white sage, black loam and a minty lift. The palate is juicy but restrained, with ripe olallieberries cut by licorice and tobacco, bound together with considerable grip.                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "51866   The aromatics immediately capture your attention, mixing baking spices with fennel, wet rock, and ginger cake. Compact, young, fresh fruit flavors suggest pomegranate, wild raspberry and very tart cherries. This is an acid-lover's wine, with the structure to age for decades.                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "32544   A terrific blush bubbly, rich and sophisticated in the mouth. The mousse is very fine and silky, and the flavors are just tremendous. Raspberries, strawberries, brioche, sweet vanilla and toast end in a long, opulent swirl of spices. This Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend comes mostly from Napa and Sonoma counties.                                                                                                  \n",
       "13217   Stalky, lightly herbal aromas are suggestive of horse and leathery berry fruits. This has hard tannins and a moderate structure, while stalky, baked berry flavors finish tough, with little give.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "86651   This is one of the only Rieslings to come out of the valley. The aromas are reserved for the variety, with notes of lime leaf, citrus, Bosc pear and nut oil. The palate drinks dry, and is flavorful, with abundant stone-fruit and citrus notes that linger. It seems a bit heavy handed but still brings enjoyment.                                                                                                      \n",
